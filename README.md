#Create a microservice
We would like you to build a Microservice that exposes a couple endpoints to return the
following information. We would also like a simple UI to display the information.

We have provided a CSV of user information; we would like you to build to build the following
endpoints:
- Endpoint to return a specific user (and all associated information)
- Endpoint to return a list of users created between a date range
- Endpoint to return a list of users based on a specific profession
- Custom Endpoint that you design on your own.
